# ComputerCraft Shop Stock Tracker
A simple program made in Lua for use in the videogame "Minecraft" in conjunction with a mod named "ComputerCraft" that tracked the stock available in my shop, and also displaying it graphically therefore making it easier to know when there was a need to restock.
Also a very simple program used to display the shop name in a scrolling coloured sign.
